Buffon's Needle is a probability problem originially discussed in the 18th century. The problem revolves around needles of a given length, and a floor that has parallel lines equidistant from each other continuing forever. The goal is to determine the probability that a needle randomly thrown anywhere on the floor intersects one of those lines based upon its length and the distance between the lines.

I did this work under two assumptions. The first is that the length of the needle must be less than the distance between the lines, this simplified the work because it eliminates the chance that the needle intersects the line twice. The second assumption is that there is no preference for the way a needle falls. The needles will be evenly distributed across their statespace.

## Representing the Needle and the Floor

In order to create simulations of a needle being thrown onto a floor, the needle and the floor must be represented by their most relevant properties. These properties are numerical ways of describing these objects. Any needle thrown onto the floor can be described by its length, $x$ position, $y$ position and $\angle\theta$ from vertical. The floor can be described by just the distance between the lines because it is stated that they are parallel and continue repeating forever. 

#### Peridic Boundary Conditions in the $y$ Direction

These are useful, but in order to maximize the efficiency of the program it would be best to only focus on the variables that are relevant to the problem. For the sake of the program it would be useful to reduce the infinite floor to a single unit cell. We can first reduce the $y$ component of the problem. If we examine two needles that are identical in all aspects except for their $y$ component, we notice that they will intersect the line in the same way, just at different heights, or neither will intersect the line. This means that the $y$ variable does not have an impact on whether the needle intersects a line, and we do not need it for our calculations. This reduces our unit cell to just the $x$ direction.

#### Periodic Boundary Conditions in the $x$ Direction

In the $x$ direction the lines are $d$ distance apart and repeat to infinity. The simulation needs to model a needle being dropped anywhere on this infinite floor, and it is impractical to create an infinite floor for the simulation. If we define two lines and the space between them as a chunk, we can see that each chunk would be identical. If two identical needles were placed in separate chunks and they were the same distance from the lines they would interact with the lines in the same way. This means that by only dropping needles in one chunk it shows how a needle placed in the same way in the next chunk would behave the same way, either they both intersect or they both don't. The unit cell for the $x$ direction is then reduced to $0 \leq x \leq d$.

#### Periodic Boundary Conditions for $\angle\theta$

The $\angle\theta$ from vertical can also be reduced. It would make sense to have $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ however there is some symmetry to take advantage of. We are rotating the needle about its center, so once $\theta$ reaches $\pi$ it will repeat angles. For example, since $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ contains $\frac{\pi}{4}$ there is no need to test a $\frac{5 \pi}{4}$ because they would describe the same needle.

#### Unit Cell for the Simulation

$$R = \left \{ (x,\theta) \mid 0\leq x\leq d,0\leq \theta \leq \pi \right \}$$

## Testing for Intersection

A needle will intersect a line if part of the needle exists within the unit cell I described above, and part of it exists past the boundary, or line, that defines the unit cell. The way the unit cell is described makes it so that the $x$ values describing the center of the needles exist within two lines, now it is assumed that part of the needle will exist within the unit cell. Now all that needs to be done is check the $x$ values of the endpoints of the needles, and if those are outside the unit cell (one is less than 0 or greater than $d$), then the needle intersects a line. 

The $x$ value of an endpoint is found by getting the $x$ value for the center of the needle, and then adding or subtracting the distance to an endpoint. This distance is equal to $\frac{l}{2}sin\theta$. This generates two conditions for whether or not a needle crosses a line. This is where the assumption that $l < d$ is important because it restricts all needles to only intersecting once, no needle can satisfy both equations.

<center>$x+\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\geq d$ and $x-\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\leq0$</center>

## Calculating Probability Analytically

To calculate the probability of a needle intersecting a line we can graph the state space of the needle, plotting the two functions that describe intersecting needles, and only examining them while $0\leq x\leq d$ and $0\leq \theta \leq \pi$. The box describes all the possible variations of a needle with constant $l$ and $d$. The functions describe which needles will intersect the lines. If the area in the functions is divided by the area of the box. 

The area of the total state space of the needle can be represented by:

<center>$$A_w=\int_{0}^{\pi}(d)d\theta=d\pi$$</center>

The area of the function $x-\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\leq0$ is:

<center>$$A_1=\int_{0}^{\pi}(\frac{l}{2}sin\theta)d\theta=l$$</center>

The area of the function $x+\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\geq d$ is:

<center>$$A_2=\int_{0}^{\pi}(d)d\theta-\int_{0}^{\pi}(d-\frac{l}{2}sin\theta)d\theta=\int_{0}^{\pi}(\frac{l}{2}sin\theta)d\theta=l$$</center>

Therefore, the total area in described by the functions is:

<center>$A_1+A_2=l+l=2l$</center>

And we can calculate the probability of a needle landing on a needle with:

<center>$P=\frac{A_1+A_2}{A_w}=\frac{2l}{d\pi}$</center>

## Calculating the Probability Through a Simulation

To calculate the probability with a simulation we will "throw" needles at random, giving them random $x$ positions and random $\theta$ values. This simulates the graph from the analytical approach. If the needles are evenly distributed in the simulation, then the percentage of needles that hits is simply the number of needles that hit divided by the total number of needles thrown.

I created a Needle struct in order to store all the needle information in one place.

{% highlight julia %}
struct Needle
    x::Number
    length::Number
    θ::Number
end
{% endhighlight %}

I also created a throw\_needle function that generates random needles in the state space given by a given length of needle and distance between the lines:

{% highlight julia %}
function throw_needle(length::Number,distance::Number)
    return Needle(rand()*distance,length,rand()*π)
end
{% endhighlight %}

The part that generates the probability takes the array of needles and makes a new array, overlaps, that stores True if the given needle intersects, and False if it doesn't. It then uses the count method to get the total number of overlaps, stored in sum\_hits. In my code I used a num\_throws variable to call whenever the number of needles is needed, so when I calculate the probability I can simply divide sum\_hits by num\_throws

I created a state\_space function that would plot out randomly generated needles in their state space, with red dots representing needles that intersected a line, and blue dots representing ones that didn't. This was valuable because once the data was graphed, the curves $x+\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\geq d$ and $x-\frac{l}{2}sin\theta\leq 0$ from the analytical approach were noticeable.

When I would run the simulations, I would compare the theoretical probability $\frac{2l}{d\pi}$ with the probability calculated from the simulation.
