# Join our mission

We are looking for graduate and undergraduate students interested in computational modeling and applied mathematics. Current research topics, while evolving, are described [here]({{ site.url }}). If you are a student with interest in joining the Simon Ensemble, I encourage you to contact me at Cory.Simon [at] oregonstate.edu to discuss potential research projects. Please include your CV and a short statement of your interests and career goals.

# My Advising Style

We work *together* towards a common mission.

> If you want to build a ship, 
> don't drum up the people 
> to gather wood, divide the 
> work, and give orders. 
> Instead, teach them to yearn 
> for the vast and endless sea. 
> :microphone: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

I am invested in my students' learning and success; my success as an assistant professor is predicated on my students'.

> Train people well enough so they can leave;
> treat them well enough so they don't want to.    
> :microphone: Richard Branson

I hope each student works on a project that he/she finds fascinating and impactful. Motivation to work diligently on a research project should stem from curiosity and the desire to make a positive impact. Our work has the potential to improve human lives, conserve resources, and preserve the planet. In addition, research progress is incredibly rewarding.

> Suddenly knowing what's going on, with total certainty, *all the way to the bottom*-- is a special thing, attainable in few if any other places in life. You feel you're reached into the universe's guts and put your hand on the wire. It's hard to describe to people who haven't experienced it. :microphone: Jordan Ellenberg 

When a student finds a research topic fascinating, he/she will maximize his/her learning and be fully engaged by and ingrained in his/her research project.

> Mainly play the things on the piano which please you, even if the teacher does not assign those. That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don't notice that the time passes. I am sometimes so wrapped up in my work that I forget about the noon meal. 
> :microphone: Albert Einstein

Though research articles in peer-reviewed, scientific journals are our primary currency, I encourage students in the group to occasionally write posts in our [group blog]({{ site.url }}/blog/). The content may be directly related to our research, or not. The blog is intended to help students develop good writing skills, provide an outlet to advertise our research, disseminate knowledge to the public, and arouse in others excitement about/interest in science.

I am a proponent of free and open source software, data sharing, and fully reproducible research. Students can expect to use the Linux operating system (e.g., [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)) and learn free and open source programming languages [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

# Our group is at a buffet

> I think you can put scientists into two buckets. One is the type who dives very deeply into one topic for their whole career and they know it better than anybody else in the world. Then there’s the other bucket, where I would put myself, where it’s like you’re at a buffet table and you see an interesting thing here and do it for a while, and that connects you to another interesting thing and you take a bit of that. That’s how I came to be working on Crispr – it was a total side-project. :microphone: Jennifer Doudna

Fortunately, our toolbox of mathematics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning enables us to approach a variety of interesting problems.

# Oregon is awesome

Also see [Why choose OSU?](http://admissions.oregonstate.edu/international/why-choose-osu).

:evergreen_tree: Oregon is perfect for the outdoors: hiking, backpacking, camping, biking, skiing/snowboarding, rafting, etc. Beyond the cover images for this website, [here](https://www.instagram.com/outinoregon/) is a sample of the scenery you can encounter in Oregon.

:wine_glass: Corvallis is in the heart of Willamette Valley, which is known for its Pinot Noir wine.

:beer: There are several breweries in Corvallis.

:bicyclist: Corvallis is [bike-friendly](http://visitcorvallis.com/about-corvallis/corvallis-recognized-as-gold-level-bicycle-friendly-community/). There are many nearby biking trails.

:umbrella: Regarding [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvallis,_Oregon#Climate), temperatures are mild year-round in Corvallis. Rain keeps the scenery green and the air clean.

:house_with_garden: Enjoy the comforts of small town living in Corvallis: relatively affordable housing, little traffic, low crime rates, etc. Live the city life on the weekends; Portland is a fantastic city and only a 1.5 hr drive from Corvallis.

:books: Corvallis is among America's most educated cities [[source](https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/07/americas-smartest-cities-oped-cx_apa_0207smartest_slide_6.html)].
